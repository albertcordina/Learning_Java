/*
 * In Java, System.out.println(); is a statement used to print a line of text to the console.

	/*
	 * Here's a breakdown of the statement:
	 * 
System: This is a class in Java that represents the system, and it provides access to various system-related properties and methods.

out: This is a static member of the System class, which is an instance of the PrintStream class. 
It is a standard output stream, typically connected to the console or terminal.

println(): This is a method of the PrintStream class. 
The println method is used to print a line of text to the output stream. 
The empty parentheses indicate that the method is called without any arguments.

So, when you use System.out.println();, it prints an empty line to the console.

Example:
	 * 
	 */
	
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    	
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // This will print "Hello, World!" and move to the next line
        System.out.println(); // This will print an empty line
        System.out.println("This is a new line."); // This will print "This is a new line." on a new line
    }
    /*
     * This statement is commonly used for both user interaction and testing purposes. 
     * When developing a program, you might use System.out.println to output information 
     * for testing and debugging. In a production environment, you might use it to display 
     * information to users in the console. However, for a graphical user interface (GUI) 
     * application, you would typically use other means, such as message boxes or labels, 
     * to display information to users.
